# Career Ladders for Infrastructure Engineers

**Comprehensive career progression frameworks for individual contributors and managers.**

---

## Overview

**Career ladders provide:**
- Clear expectations at each level
- Transparent path to promotion
- Fair and consistent evaluation
- Motivation and retention

**Two tracks:**
1. **Individual Contributor (IC):** L3 → L4 → L5 → L6 → L7+
2. **Manager (M):** M3 → M4 → M5 → M6+

**Key principle:** IC and Manager tracks are **parallel and equal** - neither is "better" or "higher"

## Promotion Criteria

### General Principles

**What promotion means:**
- Already operating at next level for 6+ months
- Consistent performance, not one-off projects
- Clear evidence of increased scope and impact

**What promotion is NOT:**
- Reward for tenure (time != promotion)
- Consolation for not getting other opportunities
- Response to external offer
- Given preemptively for "potential"

### Promotion Process

```
Typical promotion cycle:

1. Manager Assessment (Continuous)
   ├── Observes engineer operating at next level
   ├── Collects evidence over 6+ months
   └── Discusses readiness with engineer

2. Promotion Packet (Quarterly)
   ├── Manager writes promotion packet
   ├── Evidence: Projects, impact, growth
   ├── Peer feedback (360 reviews)
   └── Scope comparison to others at level

3. Calibration (Quarterly)
   ├── Managers meet to review all packets
   ├── Compare candidates across teams
   ├── Ensure consistent bar across org
   └── Approve or defer promotions

4. Communication (After approval)
   ├── Manager shares decision with engineer
   ├── Celebration with team
   ├── Updated title and compensation
   └── New expectations discussed
```

### Common Promotion Mistakes

**Promoting too early:**
- Engineer not yet consistently operating at level
- Based on potential rather than demonstrated performance
- Result: Engineer struggles, loses confidence

**Promoting too late:**
- Engineer operating at level for 12+ months
- Manager delays due to process friction
- Result: Engineer leaves for better opportunity

**Promoting for wrong reasons:**
- Retention play after external offer
- "Owed" after missing previous cycle
- Political pressure from other teams

**Right approach:**
- Promote when ready (6-12 months at level)
- Based on consistent performance and scope
- Transparent criteria and decision process

## Lateral Moves and Career Pivots

### IC → Manager Transition

**When to consider:**
- Strong interest in people and leadership
- Track record of mentorship and collaboration
- Willing to step back from hands-on technical work
- Comfortable with ambiguity and conflict

**Process:**
- Start with tech lead role (still IC)
- Manage 1-2 interns or junior engineers
- Transition to full-time manager (M3)
- First 6 months: probation period

**Important:** Manager track is NOT a "promotion" - it's a career change

### Manager → IC Transition

**Why engineers return to IC:**
- Miss hands-on technical work
- Prefer deep work over meetings and politics
- Stronger fit for technical leadership
- Want to be principal/staff engineer

**Process:**
- Transparent conversation with leadership
- Transition plan (handoff team, find coverage)
- Return at appropriate IC level (usually L5 or L6)
- No stigma or penalty

**Important:** This is a valid career move, not a demotion

---

## Skills Development for Each Level

### L3 → L4 (0-2 years)
**Focus:** Execution and learning
- Master 2-3 core technologies deeply
- Learn debugging and troubleshooting
- Write clear documentation
- Participate in code reviews
- Shadow on-call rotation

### L4 → L5 (2-5 years)
**Focus:** Ownership and quality
- Own projects end-to-end
- Design solutions independently

- Lead incident response
- Contribute to architecture discussions

### L5 → L6 (5-8 years)
**Focus:** Technical leadership and strategy
- Lead multi-quarter initiatives
- Drive architecture decisions

- Think strategically about technical debt

### L6 → L7 (8-12+ years)
**Focus:** Organizational impact
- Drive org-wide technical strategy
- Influence engineering culture
- Mentor staff engineers
- Represent company externally
- Solve highest-impact problems

## Career Conversations

### Quarterly Career 1-on-1

**Manager preparation:**
- Review engineer's goals from last quarter
- Collect feedback from peers and cross-functional partners
- Identify growth opportunities and gaps
- Prepare specific examples of performance

**Discussion structure:**
```
1. Reflection (15 min)
   - "How do you feel about your growth this quarter?"
   - "What are you most proud of?"
   - "What was challenging?"

2. Feedback (15 min)
   - Share specific examples of strengths
   - Discuss areas for development
   - Compare to expectations for level

3. Goals (20 min)
   - Set 2-3 development goals for next quarter
   - Identify projects or opportunities for growth
   - Discuss longer-term career aspirations

4. Action plan (10 min)
   - What support does engineer need from you?
   - What skills to develop?
   - Timeline for next promotion discussion
```

### Annual Promotion Discussion

**If promotion is possible:**
- "You're on track for promotion to L[X] in next 6-12 months"
- Specific gaps to close: [list 2-3 areas]
- Projects to demonstrate readiness: [suggest opportunities]
- Timeline: Target [specific promotion cycle]

**If promotion is not yet ready:**
- "You're performing well at L[X], but not yet ready for L[X+1]"
- Clear feedback on gaps (scope, impact, technical depth)
- Specific development plan to get there
- Revisit in 3-6 months

---

## Key Takeaways for Managers

1. **Make expectations clear** - Engineers should know what's expected at their level
2. **Promote for performance, not potential** - Wait until consistently operating at level
3. **Be transparent** - Regular career conversations prevent surprises
4. **Calibrate across teams** - Ensure consistent bar across org
5. **Support growth** - Provide opportunities and feedback to help engineers level up
6. **IC and Manager tracks are equal** - Neither is superior
7. **Career pivots are healthy** - Support lateral moves and transitions
8. **Document progress** - Keep notes for promotion packets
9. **Celebrate promotions** - Make it meaningful for engineer and team
10. **Long-term thinking** - Career development takes years, not quarters

Your job is to help every engineer reach their full potential, whether that's Staff IC or Engineering Manager.
