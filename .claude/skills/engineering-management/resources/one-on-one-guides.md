# One-on-One Meeting Guides

**Comprehensive guide to running effective 1-on-1s with engineers.**

---

## Why 1-on-1s Matter

**1-on-1s are the most important meeting you have as a manager.**

They are:
- **Your primary tool** for building trust and relationships
- **Early warning system** for problems (burnout, disengagement, conflict)
- **Career development forum** for growth conversations
- **Two-way feedback channel** for manager and report
- **Safe space** for difficult conversations

**What 1-on-1s are NOT:**
- ❌ Status updates (use stand-ups or async for this)
- ❌ Manager's agenda only (this is THEIR meeting)
- ❌ Performance review (separate, formal process)
- ❌ Optional or easily canceled (highest priority meeting)

---

## Cadence and Duration

### Standard Cadence

**Weekly 30-minute 1-on-1:**
- **For:** All direct reports
- **Duration:** 30 minutes minimum
- **When:** Same day/time each week (consistency matters)
- **Format:** Video call preferred (see facial expressions, body language)

**Monthly 60-minute Career 1-on-1:**
- **For:** All direct reports
- **Duration:** 60 minutes
- **Focus:** Long-term career goals, growth, skills development
- **Separate from weekly** - different purpose and depth

### Adjusting Cadence

**More frequent (twice weekly or daily):**
- New hire in first 90 days
- Engineer struggling with performance
- Critical project or high-stress period
- Significant personal/team changes

**Less frequent (bi-weekly):**
- Staff+ engineers with high autonomy
- Strong performers who prefer more space
- **BUT:** Be careful - reducing frequency can signal lack of care

**Never skip more than 2 weeks** - relationship and trust erode quickly

## Weekly 1-on-1 Structure

### Template Agenda (30 minutes)

```
First 15 minutes - THEIR Agenda:
├── "What's top of mind for you this week?"
├── Obstacles and blockers
├── Concerns or frustrations
├── Wins and celebrations
└── Questions for you

Last 15 minutes - YOUR Agenda:
├── Project updates (if needed)
├── Feedback (both directions)
├── Team/org updates they should know
├── Planning and priorities
└── Action items recap
```

**Key principle:** First half is THEIRS, second half is yours. Don't flip this.

### Opening Questions

**Start with open-ended questions:**
- "What's top of mind for you?"
- "How are you feeling about work this week?"
- "What's been energizing? What's been draining?"
- "What's one thing I can help you with?"
- "What's going well? What's not going well?"

**Avoid:**
- "Any updates?" (too vague, leads to status update)
- "Everything good?" (closed question, easy to deflect)
- Starting with YOUR agenda (makes it your meeting, not theirs)

### Deep Listening

**Active listening techniques:**
1. **Pause before responding** - Let them finish, then pause 2-3 seconds
2. **Paraphrase back** - "So what I'm hearing is..."
3. **Ask follow-up questions** - "Tell me more about that"
4. **Validate emotions** - "That sounds frustrating"
5. **Take notes** - Shows you care, helps follow up

**Avoid:**
- Interrupting or finishing their sentences
- Immediately jumping to solutions
- Checking phone/laptop during meeting
- Multi-tasking or distracted listening
- Dismissing concerns ("that's not a big deal")

## Conversation Themes

### Theme 1: Obstacles and Blockers

**Questions:**
- "What's slowing you down this week?"
- "What blockers can I help remove?"
- "Is there anything unclear about priorities?"
- "What do you need from me or other teams?"

**Your role:** Remove obstacles, provide clarity, connect to resources

**Follow-up actions:**
- Clear blockers within 48 hours if possible
- If you can't solve it, explain why and alternatives
- Connect them to people who can help

### Theme 2: Work-Life Balance and Wellbeing

**Questions:**
- "How's your workload feeling?"
- "Are you able to disconnect after work?"
- "How's the on-call rotation impacting you?"
- "What's your stress level on a scale of 1-10?"

**Red flags to watch for:**
- Working late nights or weekends regularly
- Not taking vacation or breaks
- Appearing exhausted or burned out
- Increasing cynicism or negativity

**Your actions:**
- Proactively redistribute work if overloaded
- Encourage time off and model healthy behavior
- Address unrealistic expectations from stakeholders

### Theme 3: Team Dynamics

**Questions:**
- "How's the team dynamic lately?"
- "Anyone you'd like more/less collaboration with?"
- "Do you feel heard in team discussions?"
- "Any conflicts or friction I should be aware of?"

**Why this matters:** Problems fester if not surfaced early

**Your role:**
- Address conflicts quickly and directly
- Create space for difficult conversations
- Coach on communication and collaboration

### Theme 4: Growth and Development

**Questions:**
- "What skills do you want to develop?"
- "What kind of projects excite you?"
- "What's one thing you'd like to learn this quarter?"
- "Are there areas where you'd like more autonomy?"

**Follow-up:**
- Identify stretch projects for skill development
- Connect to mentors or learning resources
- Create opportunities for growth

### Theme 5: Feedback (Both Directions)

**Giving feedback:**
- Specific examples, not generalizations
- Timely (within days, not weeks)
- Balanced (positive and constructive)
- Actionable (clear what to do differently)

**Asking for feedback:**
- "What's one thing I could do better as your manager?"
- "What should I start/stop/continue doing?"
- "How can I better support you?"
- "Am I giving you enough context?"

**Why ask for feedback:** Shows humility, builds trust, improves your management

### Theme 6: Career and Progression

**Questions:**
- "Where do you see yourself in 2-3 years?"
- "What does success look like for you?"
- "What's your ideal next role?"
- "Are you interested in management or staying IC?"

**Follow-up:**
- Create development plan with specific goals
- Regular check-ins on progress toward goals
- Be honest about promotion timeline and criteria

## Difficult Conversations

### Performance Issues

**Structure:**
1. **State the problem clearly** - Specific examples, not vague
2. **Impact** - Why this matters (team, customers, business)
3. **Listen** - What's their perspective? Any context you're missing?
4. **Create improvement plan** - Specific actions, timeline, support
5. **Follow-up** - Regular check-ins on progress

**Example:**
> "I want to talk about missed deadlines. In the last 3 sprints, you've committed to 20 points but delivered 12. This impacts the team's ability to deliver our roadmap. Can you help me understand what's happening?"

**Listen for:**
- Lack of clarity on expectations
- Workload issues or competing priorities
- Skill gaps that need addressing
- Personal issues affecting work
- Misalignment on what "done" means

**Avoid:**
- Surprising them (feedback should be ongoing)
- Being vague ("you need to work harder")
- Comparing to other engineers
- Making it personal

### Burnout Signals

**Conversation:**
> "I've noticed you've been working late and seem exhausted. I'm concerned about your wellbeing. Can we talk about your workload?"

**If they're burned out:**
- Immediate action: Reduce workload or take time off
- Medium-term: Redistribute work, hire if needed
- Long-term: Address root cause (understaffing, unrealistic expectations, toxic culture)

**Don't:**
- Ignore the signs hoping it gets better
- Tell them to "just take a vacation" without addressing root cause
- Make them feel guilty for being burned out

### Resignation Conversations

**When they give notice:**
1. **Don't panic or guilt-trip** - "That's disappointing, but I understand"
2. **Ask why** - "Can you share what led to this decision?"
3. **Listen without defending** - Hear their reasons, don't argue
4. **Counter-offer (if appropriate)** - Only if you can fix the real issues
5. **Graceful exit** - Thank them, plan transition

**Exit interview questions:**
- "What made you start looking?"
- "What could we have done differently?"
- "What did you like about working here?"
- "Any feedback on my management?"

**Use feedback to improve** - Patterns across exits reveal systemic issues

### Conflict Between Team Members

**Your role:** Mediator, not judge

**Process:**
1. **Talk to each person separately** - Get both perspectives
2. **Facilitate conversation** - Bring them together if appropriate
3. **Focus on behaviors, not personalities** - "When X happens..." not "You are..."
4. **Find common ground** - Shared goals, mutual respect
5. **Set expectations** - Clear standards for behavior going forward

**Don't:**
- Take sides or make it about who's "right"
- Let conflict fester hoping it resolves itself
- Make it a public issue (handle privately)

## Common Mistakes

### Mistake 1: Canceling or Rescheduling

**Why it's bad:** Sends message that they're not priority

**Fix:**
- Protect 1-on-1 time in calendar (hard block)
- Only reschedule for true emergencies
- If you must cancel, reschedule same week

### Mistake 2: Turning It Into Status Update

**Why it's bad:** Wastes opportunity for deeper conversation

**Fix:**
- Get project updates async (Slack, written)
- Use 1-on-1 for coaching, feedback, career
- Ask "What do you need from me?" not "What's your status?"

### Mistake 3: Not Taking Notes

**Why it's bad:** Forget commitments, lose context over time

**Fix:**
- Keep shared doc with notes from each 1-on-1
- Action items and follow-ups tracked
- Refer back to previous conversations

### Mistake 4: Talking Too Much

**Why it's bad:** This is THEIR meeting, not yours

**Fix:**
- Listen 70%, talk 30%
- Ask open-ended questions
- Pause before jumping in with advice

### Mistake 5: Not Following Up on Action Items

**Why it's bad:** Erodes trust ("they don't follow through")

**Fix:**
- Document action items clearly
- Review at next 1-on-1
- If you can't do something, explain why

### Mistake 6: Avoiding Difficult Topics

**Why it's bad:** Problems fester, relationship stays surface-level

**Fix:**
- Address issues early and directly
- Create psychological safety for hard conversations
- Model vulnerability by asking for feedback

## Building Psychological Safety

**What is psychological safety?**
The belief that you won't be punished or humiliated for speaking up with ideas, questions, concerns, or mistakes.

**How to create it:**

1. **Model vulnerability**
   - Share your own mistakes and learning
   - Ask for feedback publicly
   - Admit when you don't know something

2. **Respond positively to bad news**
   - "Thank you for telling me" (first response)
   - Don't shoot the messenger
   - Focus on learning, not blame

3. **Ask open questions**
   - "What am I missing?"
   - "What concerns do you have?"
   - "What would you do differently?"

4. **No surprises**
   - Regular feedback (not saved for reviews)
   - Transparent about company/team changes
   - Explain the "why" behind decisions

5. **Follow through**
   - If they raise concerns, act on them
   - If you can't act, explain why
   - Close the loop on every issue raised

**Signs you've built it:**
- They share mistakes without fear
- They disagree with you in meetings
- They bring up problems early
- They ask "dumb" questions
- They give you honest feedback
