## When to Use This Skill

**You're a manager who needs help with:**
- Organizing teams (platform teams, SRE teams, security teams)
- Hiring engineers and assessing technical skills
- Building career ladders and progression frameworks
- Planning resources and capacity across teams
- Conducting technical interviews
- Running effective 1-on-1s with engineers
- Understanding team structures and reporting lines

**This skill does NOT cover:**
- Hands-on technical implementation (see technical skills)
- Executive strategy (see infrastructure-strategy skill)
- Budget/cost management (see budget-and-cost-management skill)
- Operations/on-call management (see engineering-operations-management skill)

## Core Areas

### 1. Team Organization Patterns

**Modern infrastructure team structures:**

```
Traditional Silo Model (❌ Avoid):
├── Development Team (builds features)
├── Operations Team (deploys & maintains)
└── Security Team (audits & blocks)
Result: Friction, blame, slow delivery

Platform Engineering Model (✅ Preferred):
├── Platform Team (builds developer experience)
├── Product Teams (build features using platform)
└── Enabling Teams (SRE, Security, provide expertise)
Result: Autonomy, fast delivery, shared responsibility
```

**Common team patterns:**
- **Platform Engineering Team** - IaC, K8s, CI/CD, internal developer platform
- **SRE Team** - Reliability, monitoring, incident response, SLOs
- **Security Engineering Team** - Security automation, compliance, vulnerability management
- **Cloud Engineering Team** - Cloud architecture, migration, cost optimization
- **Release Engineering Team** - CI/CD pipelines, deployment automation
- **Database Engineering Team** - Database reliability, performance, migrations

**See:** [team-organization-patterns.md](resources/team-organization-patterns.md)

### 2. Hiring & Skill Assessment

**Engineering hiring process:**

```
1. Define Role & Level
   ├── IC levels: Junior (L3) → Senior (L5) → Staff (L6) → Principal (L7+)
   ├── Skills matrix: Must-have vs Nice-to-have
   └── Compensation band

2. Source Candidates
   ├── Job description that attracts right level
   ├── Realistic preview of day-to-day work
   └── Internal referrals (highest quality)

3. Technical Assessment
   ├── Resume screen (filtering for experience level)
   ├── Phone screen (basics + fit)
   ├── Technical interview (deep dive on skills)
   ├── System design (architecture thinking)
   └── Behavioral interview (culture fit)

4. Make Offer
   ├── Sell the role and team
   ├── Competitive compensation
   └── Quick decision loop
```

**Skill assessment frameworks:**
- Platform Engineering: IaC, K8s, CI/CD, GitOps
- SRE: Observability, incident response, automation, Linux
- Security: Threat modeling, compliance, security tools
- Cloud: AWS/Azure/GCP, cost optimization, architecture

**See:** [hiring-and-assessment.md](resources/hiring-and-assessment.md)

### 3. Career Ladders

**Infrastructure engineering career ladder:**

```
Individual Contributor (IC) Track:

L3: Junior Engineer
├── Executes well-defined tasks with guidance
├── Learning fundamentals of systems/cloud/security
└── Focus: Skill development

L4: Engineer
├── Owns small-to-medium projects independently
├── Proficient in core technologies
└── Focus: Execution

L5: Senior Engineer
├── Owns large projects, mentors junior engineers
├── Expert in domain, influences team decisions
└── Focus: Technical leadership + mentorship

L6: Staff Engineer
├── Drives multi-team initiatives, sets technical direction
├── Domain expert, shapes architecture
└── Focus: Technical strategy + broad impact

L7+: Principal/Distinguished Engineer
├── Drives organization-wide technical strategy
├── Industry expert, represents company externally
└── Focus: Vision + strategic impact
```

**Manager Track:**

```
M3: Engineering Manager

```

**See:** [career-ladders.md](resources/career-ladders.md)

### 4. Resource Planning

**Capacity planning for managers:**

```
Team Capacity Model:

Available Capacity = Team Size × Available Hours
├── Team Size: Number of engineers
├── Available Hours: ~30 hrs/week per engineer
    ├── 40 hrs/week
    ├── - 2 hrs meetings
    ├── - 3 hrs context switching
    ├── - 2 hrs interruptions
    ├── - 3 hrs toil/ops work
    └── = ~30 productive hours

Capacity Allocation:
├── 70% Feature/project work
├── 20% Tech debt & refactoring
├── 10% Learning & innovation
└── Adjust based on team maturity
```

**When to hire:**
- Team consistently at >90% capacity for 3+ months
- Critical projects delayed due to capacity constraints
- Engineers working unsustainable hours
- Key person risk (single points of failure)

**When NOT to hire:**
- Temporary spike in work
- Process inefficiencies that hiring won't solve
- Unclear scope or requirements
- Budget constraints

**See:** [resource-planning.md](resources/resource-planning.md)

├── Discuss challenges
└── Surface concerns early

Last 15 min - Your Agenda:
├── Project updates & priorities
├── Feedback (both directions)
├── Career development
└── Team/org updates
```

**Monthly Career 1-on-1 (60 min):**
```
Focus on growth & development:
├── Progress toward career goals (20 min)
