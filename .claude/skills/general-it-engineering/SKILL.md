### 3. Change Management Process

```
Request → Assessment → Approval → Implementation → Review
   │           │            │             │            │
   ▼           ▼            ▼             ▼            ▼
 RFC       Impact       CAB          Scheduled    Post-Impl
Created   Analysis    Meeting        Change      Review
```

### 4. Incident Management Lifecycle

```
Detection → Logging → Categorization → Prioritization
     │          │            │                │
     ▼          ▼            ▼                ▼
Investigation → Diagnosis → Resolution → Closure
```

### 5. Service Levels

**SLA Tiers:**
```
Priority 1 (Critical):  Response: 15min, Resolution: 4hr
Priority 2 (High):      Response: 1hr,   Resolution: 8hr
Priority 3 (Medium):    Response: 4hr,   Resolution: 24hr
Priority 4 (Low):       Response: 8hr,   Resolution: 48hr
```

## Common Patterns

### Pattern 1: Service Catalog Structure

```yaml
Service Catalog:
  Business Services:
    - Email Service
      - SLA: 99.9% uptime
      - Support: 24/7
      - Cost: $10/user/month

    - File Storage
      - SLA: 99.95% uptime
      - Capacity: 1TB/user
      - Backup: Daily

  Technical Services:
    - Virtual Machines
    - Database Hosting
    - Load Balancers
```

### Pattern 2: Change Management Workflow

```
Standard Change:     Pre-approved, low risk
Normal Change:       Requires CAB approval
Emergency Change:    Expedited approval process

Example Standard Change:
- Password reset
- User account creation
- Software installation (approved list)

Example Normal Change:
- Server upgrades
- Network changes
- Application deployment

Example Emergency Change:
- Security patch (critical)
- Service restoration
- Production hotfix
```

### Pattern 3: CMDB Structure

```
Configuration Items (CIs):
├── Hardware
│   ├── Servers
│   ├── Network Devices
│   └── End-User Devices
├── Software
│   ├── Applications
│   ├── Databases
│   └── Licenses
└── Services
    ├── Business Services
    └── Technical Services

Relationships:
- Server → Hosts → Application
- Application → Depends on → Database
- Business Service → Uses → Technical Service
```
